Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a thing of the past
Seemed like the real thing, only to find much o' mistrust
Love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Much o' mistrust

Love's gone behind
In between what I find is pleasing and
I'm feeling fine Love is so confusing,
there's no peace of mind

If I fear I'm losing you
It's just no good, you teasing like you do
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a thing of the past

Seemed like the real thing,
Only to find much o' mistrust
Love's gone behind
Lost inside

Adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using please don't push me aside
We coulda made it cruising yeah
Yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing only to find much o' mistrust
Love's gone behind
